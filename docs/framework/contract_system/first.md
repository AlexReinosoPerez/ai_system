- Understand the verification process in scripts/verify.sh

Rules:
- Treat repository files as the single source of truth.
- Do not rely on memory from previous chats.
- Do not write code without an approved plan.
- Follow role-specific prompts when acting as architect, implementer, reviewer, or verifier.

Acknowledge when you are ready to proceed.
